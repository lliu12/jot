Jot is an online journaling app written with Flask and Python. To run it, navigate to the Jot directory after downloading all necessary files, then enter "flask run" in the command line. When the
app launches, users must log in to use Jot's journaling features.

When testing Jot, feel free to either register for your own account by clicking the Register tab, or log in to a test account
that's already been made. The username for this account is "username", and the password is "password".

Once logged in, you can immediately enter a journal entry tagged with up to three tags. On the other tabs in the app,
users can "flip through" their journal by viewing previous entries. On the "Entries" tab, you can view the entire journal.
By using the "Tags" tab, you can view specific sets of entries, like entries that have been tagged with "Gratitude". 
Some default tags are provided with each account, like "Memory" and "Gratitude". In the "Tags" section, users can add new tags to their accounts. 

Have fun!
